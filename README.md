# Future Learn MOOC Analysis
This project aims to build a data pipeline (mining, cleaning, munging and analysis) using the CRISP-DM approach and provide the EDA of Future Learn courses of Newcastle University on MOOC platform. In this analysis, we carried out an exploratory analysis on 7-year period datasets of a massive open online course (MOOC) developed by Newcastle University and run by the online skills provider FutureLearn for 7 year period. This is a statistical analysis of a course named “Cyber Security: Safety At Home, Online and in Life” which took 3 weeks to complete.
